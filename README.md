# 1v1-ELO-Ranking
Thanks to the creator of this repo for making an elo library:
https://github.com/djcunningham0/multielo

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Edit list.txt to contain all the things you are ranking
	Follow the format seen in the file of one thing per line
2. Make sure you have python installed
	Here's the official download page https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Run the virtual environment included
	For windows you can right click in your file browser and then click "Open in Terminal"
	Once in the terminal type: comp-env\Scripts\activate.ps1
		or copy the above and then right click to paste in the terminal
	Press enter
4. Run the program
	Type: python3 .\elo-compare.py
	Press Enter
5. After exiting the program be sure to deactivate the virtual environment by typing: deactivate

If you are on Mac or Linux you'll want to google how to use a python virtual environment. Once you've figured out how
to run one it will be helpful to know the one here is called comp-env. Also, look into how to run a python 3 file 
from the terminal in your OS. The name of the file is elo-compare.py for this step.
