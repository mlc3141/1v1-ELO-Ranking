# 1v1-ELO-Ranking
Thanks to the creator of this repo for making an elo library:
https://github.com/djcunningham0/multielo

## What?
Takes in a list from the user and allows them to do 1-on-1 comparison for an eventual ranked list.

## Why?
If you've ever done a tier list you'll know that when there are a lot of things to rank things can get unclear. <br>
This method of ranking things is really good for sorting out the minor differences, so if you have <br> a tier
already filled but aren't necessarily happy with it's ordering put the contents into this program <br> after 
enough comparisons you should have a sorted list!

## Problems
The main issue is how quickly the number of comparisons needed increases with each added choice. <br> This could
be used well as a way to sort things with the input of many people, but one person running comparisons <br> can
get old.

## Instructions:
Just edit list.txt to contain all the things you are ranking. <br>
Follow the format seen in the file of one thing per line.
